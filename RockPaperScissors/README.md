# Rock Paper Scissors

**Rock Paper Scissors** is a game where two players simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The player who wins the most games wins the game.

It is clear that the game is a pure chance game regarding statistics if players truly randomly choose their choices. However, it is not the case for human behaviour.

The study [Social cycling and conditional responses in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5199v1.pdf) suggest that the game is not purely chance game, but rather a game that is dependent on human behaviour. The study concludes as follows:

- If you lose the previous round, switch to the thing that beats the previous opponent's choice
- If you win the previos round, switch the the thing that beats your previous choice
